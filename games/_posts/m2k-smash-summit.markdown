I've watched a bit of smash, and I've always been a little curious about stats
are tracked for the game. [tafostats][tafo] is very helpful, but unfortunately
as far as I could tell, there isn't much more detail about specific in-game
statistics. Here is a little experiment that I'm trying with annotating games
to see what kind of interesting numbers could be found from SSBM tournaments.

This first post follows Mew2King's performance at Smash Summit 3 from this past
year. Because this first dataset is so small, this post *won't* try to draw any
concrete conclusions or trends from Jason's playing style. It's simply
a presentation of some numbers I found interesting from his games at the
tournament.

Before we dive in, a little about the stats that are tracked. It was all centered
around kills/deaths, and I tried to only record things that are not subjective.
For example, for each death I recorded stats like the attacker/defender's
percentage, what part of the stage did they die on (left, top, right), the move
used, and a couple others. I also recorded the timestamp for each death for
further analysis.

#### Overview

Before we get into some of the smaller details, let's go through some of the
high level stats from the tournament. In total, M2K played in 5 rounds, for
a total of 20 matches. He went 3-2 overall, and went 10-10 in his sets.
Figure 1 below is a table that represents his individual character vs.
character set records, as well as the average game time for each matchup.
